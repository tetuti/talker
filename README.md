# Speak up! :microphone:

A rather simple Gatsby site I made in order to learn more about:

- The [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API)
- Sourcing a Gatsby site form contentful, with a focus on splitting published and unpublished content into separate deploys.

The "production" branch can be found [here](https://pedantic-mahavira-fc2eb3.netlify.com/), and the staging branch [here](https://staging--pedantic-mahavira-fc2eb3.netlify.com/)
